# Improving Food Security through Crop Yield Prediction

Droughts and climate change threaten crop production which in turn impact food availability and price.

Knowing in advance what food the import and export helps
  * maintain food security
  * planning, storage for farmers
  * prevent famine
  
## Methods

The aim of this project was to
  * Predict future crop yeild from past satellite date provide by Google Earth Engine
  * Apply deep learning models (specifically CNN and LTSM) combined with ground truth data
  * Use model outputs to predict future months crop yeild in the USA and India

## Models



This is a machine learning project
